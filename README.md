**Join me for the Advent of Code this December!**

Hey!

The end of the year has come around and I've been thinking of organising an event with all of the amazing folks in IT I've met over the last few years. However, the logistics of bringing together well over 50 people is quite challenging, especially when some now live interstate and even overseas! So I'm organising something you can be a part of these holidays, even if you're now living away from Melbourne or running to a different schedule.

I'd love if you joined me this year for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). It's an annual coding challenge that runs through December, where (small) coding problems open up each day in the lead up to Christmas.

I'm setting a few milestones that come with small rewards, which you can use to do a little bit of good with this holiday season. If you can complete a few problems over the month, there'll be something for you!

- **\$5** for completing (getting a gold star) 5+ days
- **\$10** for completing (getting a gold star) 10+ days

<!---->

- **\$30** for the 1st placed participant
- **\$25** for the 2nd placed participant
- **\$20** for the 3rd placed participant
- **\$15** for the 4th/5th placed participants

If you're not sure what to put this towards, I'm happy to give you suggestions!

- Financial sponsorship for a developer or project with [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) / [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) / [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) / [Ko-Fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/) / etc...
- Grabbing coffee to catch up with that friend you haven't seen in months
- A donation to a charitable organisation whose work you support
- Funding your next personal project
- Supporting the [Advent of Code itself](https://adventofcode.com/support)

So if you'd like to take part, come join my private leaderboard!

- Sign in at https://adventofcode.com/2019/auth/login with your provider of choice
- View your private leaderboards at https://adventofcode.com/2019/leaderboard/private
- Enter my secret code `XXX` to join my leaderboard
- Wait for December 1st to roll around to get coding!

I'll be snapshotting the leaderboard at _midnight on the new year_, so you've got the _whole of December_ to complete as many problems as you can find the time to!

If you think I've missed someone, let me know so I can forward them this invite. It's going to be hard for me to keep a track of who's who if you forward it yourself!

You might also consider starting your own private leaderboard for your own office/remote buddies, and by all means go ahead! Your progress is tracked across any number of leaderboards, so all need to do is complete the the daily problems.

Best of luck, and may the most diligent coders find success!

Regards, Nicholas

PS - Nicholas, how did you get this email? If I haven't asked you directly, I probably got it from your website, LinkedIn, GitHub or from your Git commit history - asking everyone via IM got a bit too chaotic!
