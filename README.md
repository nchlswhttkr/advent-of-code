**Join me for the Advent of Code 2019!**

Hey!

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual coding challenge. Much like an Advent calendar, a new problem is unlocked every day in the lead up to Christmas.

This year, I've decided to host my own leaderboard with my own prizes for those who participate. If you're interested in participating, you can join my leaderboard with these steps.

- Sign in at https://adventofcode.com/2019/auth/login
- View your private leaderboards at https://adventofcode.com/2019/leaderboard/private
- Enter the secret code `XXX` to join my leaderboard

Now I did say there will be prizes. I'll be offering a few small cash prizes. This will be yours to spend how you'd like, though I'm happy to give suggestions.

- Financial sponsorships for a developer or project with [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) / [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) / [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) / [Ko-Fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/) / etc...
- A donation to a charitable organisation whose work you support
- Grabbing coffee with a friend to catch up
- Funding your next personal project
- Sponsoring the [Advent of Code itself](https://adventofcode.com/support)

The following prizes are up for grabs based on your score/placement at the end of the event.

- **\$50** for the 1st placed participant
- **\$40** for the 2nd placed participant
- **\$30** for the 3rd placed participant
- **\$15** for the 4th/5th placed participants

Additionally, I'm offering prizes if you participate but don't end up placing.

- **\$5** for completing (getting a gold star) at least 5 days
- **\$10** for completing (getting a gold star) at least 10 days

I'll be taking results at midnight on the new year, so you've got the whole of December to complete as many problems as you can find the time to.

In the spirit of the event, I will request that you solve the problems on your own.

If you think I've missed someone, let me know I'll forward them this invite.

Best of luck, and may the most diligent coders find success!

Regards, Nicholas
